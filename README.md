# Self_Python_Projects
When out of class, I dabble with ideas in Python to improve my competence and confidence

Most of the time, i;m thinking and wondering how to help and improve interactions, daily tasks and common occurances for the world

It might be small changes, but small changes often lead to big impacts!
And any improvement, no matter the size, is an improvement that someone will benefit from!
